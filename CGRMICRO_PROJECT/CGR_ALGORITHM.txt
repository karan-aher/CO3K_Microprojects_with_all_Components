Algorithm:

1. Start the program.

2. Initialize graphics mode:
   - Detect the graphics driver and mode.
   - Initialize the graphics system using `initgraph()`.

3. Set background color to black.

4. Display Instructions:
   - Display the instructions using `outtextxy()` for the user to press 'L', 'H', 'T', or 'P' and '1' to quit.
   - Display author information.

5. Loop indefinitely until a key is pressed (`while(1)` loop):
   - Draw shapes and elements on the screen:
     - Car Body:
       - Draw ellipses, lines, and mirrors for the car's front, rear, wheels, and side mirrors.
       - The shapes are created using `line()` and `ellipse()` functions.
     - Wheels:
       - Draw two sets of wheels using `ellipse()` and additional shapes for details.
   
6. Handle Key Press Events:
   - If '1' is pressed:
     - Exit the program.
   - If 'H' is pressed**:
     - Play a horn sound using `sound()` and `delay()`.
     - Stop the sound using `nosound()`.
   - If 'T' is pressed:
     - Perform an animation by changing colors on various parts of the car (use `floodfill()` to fill shapes).
     - Randomize colors for an animated effect.
   - If 'L' is pressed:
     - Perform a lighting effect using `floodfill()` to fill car lights and road elements with color.
     - Animate parts of the car and the road with delays for a smooth effect.
   - If 'P' is pressed:
     - Perform an animation for raising and lowering a rectangle on the screen, simulating a lifting door or other moving object.
     - Display text for lights and horn.

7. Handle Final Shapes:
   - After processing key events, draw a circle at `(300, 100)` as a decorative element.
   - Wait for a keypress using `getch()`.

8. End the program.
